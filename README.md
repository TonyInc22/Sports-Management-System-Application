### Summary
Our data model utilizes third normal form to minimize data redundancy and allow for more flexibility.
It features 8 tables with 4 indices used for optimizing each field data type, and the expected volume of entries for each.
We also utilized multiple table joins for many of our selection statements to view data. This was all created in Linux using MySQL.
